# Automated-Colour-Sorter
Goal: To create a machine that can sort objects by their colour

The idea was to make machine that could sort lego pieces by their colour. I'm a big Lego fan, and I sometimes want to build lego creations with only one colour (i.e. for a stone wall, I would need lots of grey pieces!). I also wanted to make it portable. So I made the base fold up, made some part able to be disassembled, and gave it a handle. 
I used this YouTube video for my inspiration: https://youtu.be/g3i51hdfLaw

Electronics:

TCS3200 Colour Sensor
2 servo motors
Jumper wires and breadboard
Elegoo Arduino Nano microcontroller

Results: 

It worked!

Future Plans: I'm thinking of making this into a marketable product. This, of course, is the first prototype. Next, I want to add another colour sensor so that the user can first scan the objects so that the machine can automatically know what colours to sort. Also, I want to add a keypad and LCD (liquid-crystal display) so that the user can input how many colours they want to sort, cancel if they input the wrong number; basically a whole menu system.
