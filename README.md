# Automated-Colour-Sorter
Goal: To create a machine that can sort objects by their colour

The idea was to make machine that could sort lego pieces by their colour. I'm a big Lego fan, and I sometimes want to build lego creations with only one colour (i.e. for a stone wall, I would need lots of grey pieces!). I also wanted to make it portable. So I made the base fold up, made some part able to be disassembled, and gave it a handle. 
I used this YouTube video for my inspiration: https://youtu.be/g3i51hdfLaw

Electronics:
- 1 TCS3200 Colour Sensor
- 2 Servo motors
- Jumper wires
- 1 Elegoo Arduino Nano microcontroller
- 1 Switch
- 1 Power Jack

Building Materials:
- Cardboard
- Straws
- Pipe cleaners
- Skewers
- Cardstock
- Magnets
- Hot glue

Results: 
The colour sensor was finiky, so it was reading the colours wrong. However, when it did read a colour, the bottom servo would rotate to a container. I used pony beads as the test objects and they fit pretty well between the bead conveyer and the stationary platform on the second level. I really enjoyed working on this project! I spent A LOT of time troubleshooting and learned a ton about colour sensors. This project also taught me perseverance and patience, which are key to a successful engineering career.  

Future Plans: 
I'm thinking of making this into a marketable product. This, of course, is the first prototype. Next, I want to add another colour sensor so that the user can first scan the objects so that the machine can automatically know what colours to sort. Also, I want to add a keypad and LCD (liquid-crystal display) so that the user can input how many colours they want to sort, cancel if they input the wrong number; basically a whole menu system. 

Thanks for taking the time to check out my Automated Colour Sorter project! Until next time, keep on dreaming big!
